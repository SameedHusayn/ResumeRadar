## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Google Cloud Platform account with Gmail, Drive, and Sheets APIs enabled
- Airtable account
- Google Gemini API key

### Step 1: Clone and Configure

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Generate a new encryption key: `openssl rand -hex 16`
4. Update your `.env` file with your details:

```
# basic n8n config
GENERIC_TIMEZONE="UTC"  # Set your timezone
N8N_HOST="localhost"    # Use your domain in production
N8N_PROTOCOL="http"     # Use https in production
N8N_PORT="5678"
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-key"

# API Keys
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"

# Google OAuth client
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

### Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Platform

1. Create a project in Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Gmail, Drive, and Sheets APIs
3. Configure OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth client credentials (Web application type)
5. Add authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5678/oauth2callback`
6. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

### Step 3: Set Up Airtable

1. Create an Airtable base with a "Job Descriptions" table containing:
   - Job Title
   - Job Code
   - Description
   - Skills Required
   - Experience Required
   - Location
2. Generate a Personal Access Token
3. You'll add this credential directly in n8n

### Step 4: Set Up Google Sheets

1. Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:
   - Job Title
   - Candidate Name
   - Email
   - Contact
   - Resume (will contain hyperlinks)
   - AI Score
   - AI Explanation

### Step 5: Run n8n

1. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. Access n8n at `http://localhost:5678`
3. Set up your credentials in the n8n UI:
   - Gmail account (OAuth)
   - Google Sheets (OAuth)
   - Google Drive (OAuth)
   - Airtable (API Token)
   - Gemini API Key

### Step 6: Import the Workflow

1. Go to Workflows ‚Üí Import From File
2. Select the `workflow.json` file
3. Update node configurations to match your credentials and data sources
4. Save and activate the workflow

## üöÄ Deployment Options

For production use, consider:

1. **Self-hosted server** with proper SSL certificates
2. **n8n Cloud** for managed hosting
3. **Docker with Traefik** for reverse proxy and SSL termination
4. **Authentication** for the n8n interface

## üìä How It Works

1. An email with a resume attachment arrives in the monitored inbox
2. The workflow extracts the job title from the email subject
3. It matches this against open positions in Airtable
4. The resume is uploaded to Google Drive for storage
5. Gemini AI analyzes the resume against the job requirements
6. Results are recorded in Google Sheets with:
   - Candidate information
   - AI-generated score (1-10)
   - Feedback summary
   - Link to stored resume

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
